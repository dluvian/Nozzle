# Nozzle

Nozzle is a lightweight nostr client for Android.

## Installation

Install it via [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)
or go to the [release page](https://github.com/dluvian/Nozzle/releases) and download the latest apk
file.

I don't plan to publish this app in the Google Play Store.
